# Title: Show me your plate and I tell you who you are

Abstract 

While the paper explores the general Twitter graph properties, we propose to study if we can detect political division in the graph. To do so, we propose to build an additional dataset with US politicians' Twitter handles and political alignments, and assign their corresponding nodes in the Twitter graph an appropriate label (e.g. "democrat" or "republican"). We will then run a community detection algorithm on the Twitter graph of followers, and see whether we can detect political clusters and their shapes, and to what extent they may be connected. Since visualizing the full graph may be challenging due to its size, we may have to find alternative methods to study the result. This would allow us to understand a small part of the political landscape, and reflect on how it reflects or affects the real landscape, and how that can be improved (for example, by encouraging more cross-party communication).

Research Questions

A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

Proposed dataset

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you've read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the datasets at hand.
