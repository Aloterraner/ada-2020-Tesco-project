# Title: Show me your plate and I tell you who you are

### Abstract 

The Paper introduces a novel dataset and with it explores the interrelations of nutrion and health. This utilizes the easy association between the Tesco data and aviable census data, which we want to extend on to explore to see if food is a dividing factor or a great unifier in a society.
We propose to combine the data set with aviable census data to explore relationships between socie-economic factors - such as wealth, education, ethnicity and cultural background -, and nutrion.
The association to the Greater London area allows us to explore the inter-relation between nutrion and other census data in a socie-economically diverse metropolitian area.  
This association also allows us to explore geodata based visaulization and to make a possibly interactive Map/s of London, that can be explored. 

While the paper explores the general Twitter graph properties, we propose to study if we can detect political division in the graph.
To do so, we propose to build an additional dataset with US politicians' Twitter handles and political alignments, and assign their corresponding nodes in the Twitter graph an appropriate label (e.g. "democrat" or "republican").
We will then run a community detection algorithm on the Twitter graph of followers, and see whether we can detect political clusters and their shapes, and to what extent they may be connected.
Since visualizing the full graph may be challenging due to its size, we may have to find alternative methods to study the result.
This would allow us to understand a small part of the political landscape, and reflect on how it reflects or affects the real landscape, and how that can be improved (for example, by encouraging more cross-party communication).


### Research Questions

A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

Who is a Tesco customer, can we find difference in areas were Tesco operates dominantly? 
Is there a significant difference in nutrients, both individual and in their distribition between different cultural groups? 
What impact do different socie-economic circumstances have on calories, nutrients and nutrient diversity? 
Can we train a predictive model that is able to predict socio-economic facts about an area based on nutrion? 



### Proposed dataset

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you've read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the datasets at hand.

### Proposed Timeline

- The amuse-gueule (Setting up the Enviroments and making sure our tools are up-to-date and ready for the tasks)
- The bread and butter (Data Loading, Cleaning and Pre-Processing)
- The entr√©e ()
- The main dish ()
- The side dish ()
- The dessert (Making it a coherent data story)
- The cherry on top (Exploring more advanced visualization of the Data, to allow interactive exploration of the results)



### Organization within the team

The amuse-geule was pre-prepared by Sous-Chef Luca and Michael. We setup the enviroments we need for processing and later visualization, with an initial struggle. Addionally we acquiered data sets, in this instance GeoJson that we requiere for the later planned visualization.

### Questions for TAs

Do our semi-serious or humorous texts annoy you or do they lighten up the monotony of looking at 5 times the same project? Should we continue in the more casual style or become more laconic and embrass our inner german-ness? We can stop ... Promise!
